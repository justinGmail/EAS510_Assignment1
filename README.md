# EAS 510 Assignment 1: Digital Forensics Apprentice My Stuff

Dataset for building a rule-based expert system that matches modified images back to their originals.

## Dataset Structure

```
EAS510_Assignment1/
├── originals/        # 10 original JPEG images
├── modified_images/  # 60 "easy" cases (single transformations)
├── hard/             # 60 "hard" cases (combined transformations)
└── random/           # 15 unrelated images (should be rejected)
```

## Transformations

### Easy Cases (modified_images/)
Each original has 6 modifications:
- Brightness enhancement
- JPEG compression
- 25% crop (center)
- 50% crop (center)
- 75% crop (center)
- PNG format conversion

### Hard Cases (hard/)
Each original has 6 challenging modifications:
- **v1**: Off-center crop + compression
- **v2**: Crop + brightness + compression
- **v3**: Resize + compression
- **v4**: Rotation + compression
- **v5**: Contrast + compression
- **v6**: Crop + resize + compression

## Ground Truth

The filename prefix indicates which original each image was derived from:
- `modified_03_brightness.jpg` → `original_03.jpg`
- `original_03__rotate6deg__compress__q50__v4.jpg` → `original_03.jpg`

Images in `random/` are not derived from any original and should be rejected.

## Setup

```bash
pip install pillow opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

Clone this repository and use the images to build and test your forensic matching system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1.git
cd EAS510_Assignment1
```

Your system should:
1. Register the 10 original images
2. For each test image, determine which original it came from (or reject it)
3. Display transparent reasoning showing how each rule contributed to the decision
